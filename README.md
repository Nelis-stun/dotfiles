# Dotfiles

Hello! My name is Niels, and these are my dotfiles. This repository contains the configurations I use daily to set up my development environment.
It's a single place where I store all the configurations for my system, making it easier to replicate my setup across machines or share it with others.

## Installation Guide

To get started with my dotfiles on your machine, follow these steps:

**NOTE**

This is only tested on Ubuntu

---

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your home directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

### 2. Navigate to the dotfiles directory

```sh
cd ./dotfiles
```

### 3. Run install script

```sh
./install.sh
```

## Additional Notes

Symlinks: The script will create symlinks to the appropriate configuration files, so your home directory stays organized and clean.
Customization: Feel free to modify the dotfiles or the installation script as needed for your specific use case.
